# Advanced-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to create a fast API that returns sentiment and reason for sentences sent on social media from users. Sentenses are sent in a post request and passed to openai. Then, sentiment and reason  for every sentense is returned as a result from advanced sentiment analysis. An automatic email is sent to the user with the results in the form of an excel file.
